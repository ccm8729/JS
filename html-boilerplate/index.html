    <!--this is a comment-->
    <p>In my previous life, I worked in supply chain/logistics, and eventually IT as a business analyst - gathering requirements for new programs, designing logic, database connections, and eventually testing programs as they were returned from developers, prepared for production implimentations. </p>
    <p>In my new life, I chose to chase change: 
        <ul> <li>A new career</li> <li>new languages</li> <li>a new country</li> <li>a new place to live</li><li>new friends</li></ul>
    Will you be a part of that change?
