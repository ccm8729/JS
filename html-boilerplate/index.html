            Professionally, I have a history and experience in business analaysis.  This includes every step in the software development life cycle, from gathering requirements from users related to new/modified programs, to designing specifications for programmers to follow through the development process.  And of course, it means quality testing what's returned, and monitoring the turnover process between test and production environments.

            Personally, I'm a laid back and easy going individual.  My hobbies vary, from hockey to reading, camping, hiking, as well as travel and exploring new places. I've got plenty of photos from those travels, including mountains, oceans, city scapes and portraits!
