            Summary!
        </p>
        </p>
        <p> I am Chris Fedosick - born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania USA, I moved to Germany in November 2023 to pursure a change in lifestyle.  As part of this journey, I aim to learn to code</p>
        <p>In my previous life, I worked in supply chain/logistics, and eventually IT as a business analyst </p>
        <p>
            Now, I'm teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JS in an attempt to become employable in Germany, with the goal of obtaining an EU blue card.  This website was designed as part of that objective, as a demonstration of the process I go through to learn to code, as well as the skills and abilities I'm developing as I continue this process.  It was designed completely by myself, without the aid of Wix, Squarespace, or similar software.  I'm happy to display/provide the source code to you as demonstration of that fact.
        </p>
        <p>In my new life, I chose to chase change: 
                <ul> <li>A new career</li> <li>new languages</li> <li>a new country</li> <li>a new place to live</li><li>new friends</li></ul>
        Will you be a part of that change?

            Professional Summary!
        </p>
        <p>
            Professionally, I have a history and experience in business analaysis.</p>
        <p>
            This includes every step in the software development life cycle, from gathering requirements from users related to new/modified programs, to designing specifications for programmers to follow through the development process.  And of course, it also means quality testing what's returned, and monitoring the turnover process between test and production environments.

            Personally, I'm a laid back and easy going individual.  My hobbies vary, from hockey to reading, camping, hiking, as well as travel and exploring new places.

        <p>
            In addition to freinds and familiar, I have one very important person in my life - Juliette.  As a French woman living in Germany, ou relationship has been a long distance one - difficult, yet rewarding.  She is the love of my life, without question.  Intelligent, she speaks 3 languages at a native level, and is almost fluent in a fourth.  She's also charismatic, often making those around her laugh.  Juliette has a number of qualities which have made me fall in love with her - her kind heart, her passionate personality, the inquisitive nature she ahs for trying absolutely anything new...
