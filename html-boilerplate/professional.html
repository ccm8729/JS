            I began my career in supply chain in 2014, working to forecast OEM and aftermarket demands in support hydraulic hose consumers in industries such as oil and gas, open pit and underground mining,aerospace, and more.

            Around 2015 I began a transition in my career - from supply chain and order/demand forecasting, into business analysis.  Understanding the ERP's our companies worked with, including Profit 21 and Microsoft Navision.  In addition, it was my job to interface barcode scanners with those systems where neccessary.  Gradually, I became more systems focused and less supply chain/operations focused.  By 2019, as my employeer changed ERP's to Infor's M3 systems, I was one of the lead business analysts on the projects, confirming that the system was a good fit for our comapny, testing setups, and responsible for data migration processes between the old and new systems.
